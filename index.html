            <h2>Welcome!</h2>

            <img src="img/CuteCatHeyThere.webp" alt="">

            <p>
                Hello! And welcome to my humble blog abode. If you are here looking for a story, you are in luck because
                I will tell you about my journey. "What journey," you say? Well, I didn't have to ignite an evil ring on
                fire by throwing it into a volcano, go to a magical school inheriting 99 wizardry problems, or finding
                out my father is a dark sith lord. My journey is about becoming a full stack developer and acquiring the
                skills at the Awesome Inc. Bootcamp. So welcome aboard!
            </p>

            <div>
                <h2 id="week1">Week 1</h2>
            </div>

            <p>
                I didn't have many expectations for the first week, but it would be fast and remote. Once we had our
                orientation about the Bootcamp, I immediately started studying every day until my brain felt like a hot
                air balloon.
            </p>

            <p>I learned how to use the Linux/Mac terminal by reading <a
                    href="https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial/basics"> "Learn Enough Command Line to be
                    dangerous"</a>,
                read through the documentation for git, and worked through the tutorial labs for GitHub. I was still
                getting used to the git workflow and made mistakes with switching between the main branch and the
                featured branches. Sometimes I would forget to update my git local branch to my GitHub remote branch,
                but I knew that repetition and practicing would eventually eliminate those mistakes</p>

            <p>I was eager to learn more about the terminal's advanced commands and work more efficiently to rid myself
                of the commoner's computer mouse and dive more into git. But I had to take my time and make sure I
                learned the foundations before I got into the meat and potatoes of the Bootcamp.</p>

            <h2 id="week2">Week 2</h2>

            <p>Week 2 was all about HTML and CSS! I had some knowledge about HTML but never dabbled with CSS. I learned
                a LOT of terms that I start to realize how crucial pseudo coding is. If I wanted to build the best web
                page known to humankind, I needed some pseudo code in my life.</p>

            <p>With the overflow of knowledge came the struggles. My struggles were more of being too timid about
                utilizing GitHub because I was scared that I would mess up somebody else's work that I was forking
                (Cloning). When I started to write my HTML code out, I felt like my HTML structure wasn't professional.
                I know with a lot of practice, I would get better.</p>

            <p>I'm eager to learn how we bring HTML, CSS, and javascript together to build impressive webpages we see on
                the internet. But like last week, I needed to take my studies one week at a time.</p>

            <h2 id='week3'> Week 3</h2>
