Hello! And welcome to my humble blog abode. If you are here looking for a story, you are in luck because I will tell you about my journey. "What journey," you say? Well, I didn't have to ignite an evil ring on fire by throwing it into a volcano, go to a magical school inheriting 99 wizardry problems, or finding out my father is a dark sith lord. My journey is about becoming a full stack developer and acquiring the skills at the Awesome Inc. Bootcamp. So welcome aboard!

## Week 1
I didn't have many expectations for the first week, but it would be fast and remote. Once we had our orientation about the Bootcamp, I immediately started studying every day until my brain felt like a hotair balloon.

I learned how to use the Linux/Mac terminal by reading [Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial/basics), read through the documentation for git, and worked through the tutorial labs for GitHub. I was still getting used to the git workflow, and I made mistakes with switching between the main branch and the featured branches. Sometimes I would forget to update my git local branch to my GitHub remote branch, but I knew that repetition and practicing would eventually eliminate those mistakes.

I was eager to learn more about the terminal's advanced commands and work more efficiently to rid myself of the commoner's computer mouse and dive more into git. But I had to take my time and makesure I learned the foundations before I got into the meat and potatoes of the Bootcamp.
